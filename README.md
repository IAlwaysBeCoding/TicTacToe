#### What is this?

* ###A Tic Tac Toe game for the current games: 
 > #### 3x3 3-in-a-row
 > #### 4x4 4-in-a-row
 > #### 5x5 5-in-a-row
 > #### All 2-Dimensionals for now

* ###Tic Tac Toe will provide
 * ####A tic-tac-toe engine that will run on hashes
 * ### Possible Hashes
 	* #####`Cell` : A Cell is an empty cell, a player 1 cell, or player 2 cell. 
 	* #####`Move` : A Move is a type of cell but only for player 1 or player 2

* * #### This is still a work in progress, and there is an [API documentation]((http://ialwaysbecoding.github.io/TicTacToe) that is being updated. Eventually, am trying to make a [gitbook](https://gitbook.com) too if time allows it.
